# Summary
A repository from Node.js projects from basic to advanced level.

# How to run project
Make sure your computer has `NodeJS` and `npm` installed (I recommend the latest version of `NodeJS` and `npm`).
Install dependencies and start the server:

```sh
$ cd example-project
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For some particular project, nodemon may be used for faster development. Check the `package.json` to find the scripts.
